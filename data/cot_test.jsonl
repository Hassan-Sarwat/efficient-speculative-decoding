{"instruction": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "input": "", "output": "<thought> **Problem-Solving Breakdown: Natalia's Clip Sales**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this problem. First, the user needs the total clips Natalia sold in April and May. Simple enough. I need to break down the information given and structure the solution systematically.\n\nI see that Natalia sold clips to 48 friends in April. Now, I'm making a quick assumption, which is critical in word problems like this. Does \"sold to 48 friends\" mean she sold 48 clips, or that she sold *some* clips to 48 people, but the amount is unknown? I need to clarify that. Based on the usual structure of similar problems, \"sold to 48 friends\" means she sold 48 clips. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable!\n\nNext, May sales are \"half as many\" as April. Okay, this sets up the calculation nicely. Now to get the desired result, I simply need to determine the total (April + May).\n\nSo, let's step through this. In April, she sold 48 clips (our assumption). In May, it's half of that, which is 48 divided by 2. That's 24 clips. Now, to get the total, just add April's sales to May's. 48 + 24 is, mentally, 72. I can confirm this via a check.\n\nTherefore, the total is 72 clips. That seems logical and is the only answer based on how the problem is stated. I will make sure the breakdown is clear in my response. I will reiterate April's sales, then May, and then the final total, showing the breakdown of the calculation.\n\n\n </thought> #### Natalia sold **72** clips altogether.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **April:** She sold **48** clips.\n2.  **May:** She sold half as many as April, which is $48 / 2 = 24$ clips.\n3.  **Total:** $48 + 24 = 72$ clips."}

How much did she earn?", "input": "", "output": "<thought> **Solving for Weng's Earnings: A Detailed Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so the problem's straightforward: Weng makes $12 an hour and worked 50 minutes. I need to figure out her total pay. My immediate thought is, \"Units don't match; gotta convert.\"\n\nMy first instinct is to think, \"How many minutes are in an hour?\" Easy, 60. Then I'll calculate earnings per minute. $12 divided by 60 minutes gives me $0.20 per minute.  Fifty minutes at $0.20 per minute is $10.00. Bingo.\n\nBut, I also see another path: converting time to hours. Fifty minutes is 50/60, or 5/6 of an hour. Then, I multiply the hourly rate of $12 by 5/6. Twelve divided by six is two; two times five equals ten. Again, $10.00.\n\nI always like a third check, too. It's almost mental math. $12 for 60 minutes.  I know 10 minutes is a sixth of an hour. $12 divided by 6 is $2 every 10 minutes. She worked 50 minutes, or five 10-minute intervals. Five times two equals ten. $10.00.  Nice.\n\nFinally, does it make sense?  Fifty minutes is a bit less than an hour, so it should be a bit less than $12. Yes, $10 feels right.\n\nSo, Weng earned **$10**. Here's the explanation:  Either calculate the per-minute earnings ($12/60 minutes = $0.20/minute; $0.20 * 50 minutes = $10.00) or express the time as a fraction of an hour (50/60 = 5/6 hour; $12 * 5/6 = $10). Both methods confirm the answer.\n\n\n </thought> #### Weng earned **$10**.\n\nHere is how to figure that out:\n\n1.  There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n2.  Since Weng worked 50 minutes, she worked for $\\frac{50}{60}$ (or $\\frac{5}{6}$) of an hour.\n3.  To find her earnings, multiply the hourly rate by the fraction of the hour worked:\n    $$12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 10$$"}

Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, the goal is crystal clear: determine the *additional* funds Betty requires.  I need to arrive at a single numerical answer representing the shortfall.\n\nNext, I need to extract and understand the key pieces of information. The wallet costs $100.  Betty has half that amount to start.  Her parents kick in $15, and her grandparents give twice that much.  This is a pretty straightforward money problem.\n\nNow, let's work it step-by-step.  Firstly, Betty's starting amount. \"Half of what she needs\" translates directly to half the wallet price, meaning $100 / 2 = $50. So, she begins with $50.\n\nSecondly, the grandparents' contribution is twice the parents'.  Since the parents gave $15, the grandparents contribute $15 * 2 = $30.\n\nNext, I need to add up all her resources. Betty's initial $50, plus the parents' $15, and the grandparents' $30. This equals $50 + $15 + $30, which equals $95.\n\nFinally, I calculate the difference between the wallet's price and her current total. The wallet is $100, and she has $95. Therefore, she needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.\n\nTo ensure my confidence in this methodology, I'll review it. The wallet is $100. Betty starts with $50. Her parents' donation is $15 and the grandparents' contribution is $30. Totaling these amounts gets me $95. A remaining $5 is needed to reach the wallet's total.

Seems straightforward enough, but let's break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key pieces of information. We've got the total book length (120 pages), yesterday's reading (12 pages), today's pace (twice yesterday), and the target for tomorrow (half the *remaining* pages).\n\nNow, let's attack this step-by-step. I'll need to figure out how many pages were read today, and then how many pages are left.\n\n*   **Today:** Yesterday was 12 pages, and today's reading is double that. So, that's $2 * 12 = 24$ pages.\n*   **Total Read:** Adding yesterday's and today's pages gets me the grand total read so far: $12 + 24 = 36$ pages.\n*   **Remaining:** To find what's left, I subtract the total read from the book's total: $120 - 36$. Doing the math: $120 - 30 = 90$ and $90 - 6 = 84$ pages remaining.\n*   **Tomorrow:** Finally, the problem says tomorrow's target is half of the remaining pages. So, that's $84 / 2 = 42$ pages.\n\nJust to be sure, let's quickly double-check: 12 (yesterday) + 24 (today) + 42 (tomorrow) = 78. Plus the 36 pages. Plus the initial 84 pages. Plus the 120 pages.

{"instruction": "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?", "input": "", "output": "<thought> **Solving the Letter-Writing Problem**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to understand what's being asked.  James is writing letters - that's the core. I need to figure out how many pages he'll write in a year. The given information spells out the parameters: 3 pages per letter, 2 friends, twice a week, and a year.\n\nNow, I break this down into manageable steps.  Initially, I thought about pages per friend per session, but the wording \"to 2 different friends\" clarifies that each friend receives a full 3-page letter.  So, one session involves 3 pages/letter * 2 friends, making 6 pages written.\n\nNext, I calculate weekly output. Since he writes twice a week, I multiply the pages per session (6) by the frequency (2) to get 12 pages per week.\n\nFinally, I determine the yearly total.  There are 52 weeks in a year, and with 12 pages/week, the calculation is 12 * 52.  I quickly calculate this as 624.\n\nBefore I'm done, I always verify.  An alternative is to count the letters.  He writes 2 letters * 2 times = 4 letters per week. Over 52 weeks, that's 208 letters.  Each letter is 3 pages, so 208 * 3 is again 624.  That confirms the answer.\n\nI carefully review for any possible ambiguities or subtle wording issues. Is the 3-page letter the same for both friends?  I have to interpret the most common way which is that it is two distinct letters. Is it exactly 52 weeks in a year or does it round? I round it since it is typical for this type of problem.\n\nFinally, I formulate the answer, presenting the steps and math:\n1.  James writes to 2 friends, each getting 3 pages. ($2 \\times 3 = 6$ pages)\n2.  He does this twice a week. ($6 \\times 2 = 12$ pages per week)\n3.  There are 52 weeks in a year. ($12 \\times 52 = 624$).\n\n**Therefore, the answer is 624 pages.**\n\n\n </thought> #### Here is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Pages per writing session:** James writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends.\n    $3 \\text{ pages} \\times 2 \\text{ friends} = 6 \\text{ pages}$\n\n2.  **Pages per week:** He does this twice a week.\n    $6 \\text{ pages} \\times 2 \\text{ times} = 12 \\text{ pages per week}$\n\n3.  **Pages per year:** There are 52 weeks in a year.\n    $12 \\text{ pages} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks} = 624 \\text{ pages}$\n\nJames writes **624** pages a year."}

The details are straightforward: Mark's garden has yellow, purple, and green flowers, with specific relationships between their quantities.

I note the knowns: 10 yellow flowers, purple being 80% more than yellow, and green being 25% *as many as* the sum of yellow and purple. I can see the structure of the solution.\n\nNext, I tackle the purple flowers. It's 80% *more* than 10 yellow flowers. I understand this means I need to find 80% of 10 (which is 8), and then add that to the original 10. *A quick check in my head* confirms this is equivalent to multiplying 10 by 1.8.  Either way, the result is 18 purple flowers.\n\nThen, I move onto the green flowers. The key is to calculate 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers. I add the yellow and purple counts (10 + 18 = 28) and find 25% of that sum. 25% is the same as dividing by 4, so 28/4 = 7. There are 7 green flowers.\n\nFinally, I find the total.  I simply add the counts for each color: 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 7 (green) = 35.

How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?", "input": "", "output": "<thought> **Solving for the Shoe Cost: A Detailed Breakdown**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this problem.  First, the goal is clear: figure out how much Alexis spent on those shoes.  I've got a budget, and I know what she spent on everything else. So, a basic algebraic approach seems appropriate.\n\nI've got all the pieces of the puzzle: a total budget of $200, costs for the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt, and a little bit of money leftover. The unknown is the shoes, so I'll represent that with \"x\".\n\nLet's start by formulating an equation:  The total budget *must* equal the sum of all the expenses, plus whatever cash is left over. That gives me:  $200 = (Shirt + Pants + Coat + Socks + Belt + Shoes) + Remaining.  Or $200 = ($30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 + x) + $16.\n\nNow, for the calculation.  I'll first add up the known expenses. It's $30 + $46 = $76, then $76 + $38 = $114, then $114 + $11 = $125 and finally, $125 + $18 = $143.  So, the known expenses are $143.\n\nNext, I'll add that $16 leftover to the known expenses. So, $143 + $16 = $159. This gives me what's already accounted for, excluding the shoes.\n\nTo find the cost of the shoes, I can subtract this from the total budget. This will isolate the unknown. So, the cost of shoes must equal $200 (budget) - $159 (accounted for) = $41. Simple enough.\n\nAlternatively, I could do repeated subtraction from the budget: $200 - $30 - $46 - $38 - $11 - $18 - $16.  Each subtraction takes away the cost of an item. That works out to be $41 as well. The math seems good, it is not too complex.\n\nFinally, just to be sure, I'll verify the answer:  Do all those costs *including* $41 for the shoes add up to $200?  $143 (all items) + $41 (shoes) = $184, and then + $16 leftover does indeed equal $200.  It checks out perfectly.\n\nTherefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.
