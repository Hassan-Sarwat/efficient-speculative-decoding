\[4 \le x - 1 \le 9,\]or $5 \le x \le 10.$  Thus, the solution is $x \in \boxed{[5,10]}.$",[510],5 \le x \le 10,5 \le x \le 10
N/A,"We can write
\[\frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + \frac{y}{x}.\]Note that $x$ is always negative and $y$ is always positive.  Thus, to maximize $\frac{y}{x},$ we should take the smallest value of $x$ and the smallest value of $y,$ which gives us
\[1 + \frac{2}{-4} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]",\frac{1}{2},0.5,0.5
N/A,"Since $P(0) = 0,$ $e = 0.$  Let the other $x$-intercepts be $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ and $s,$ so
\[P(x) = x(x - p)(x - q)(x - r)(x - s).\]Note that $d = pqrs.$  Since the $x$-intercepts are all distinct, $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ and $s$ are all nonzero, so $d$ must be nonzero.  Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}}.$

Any of the other coefficients can be zero.  For example, consider
\[x(x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 2) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x\]or
\[x(x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 4) = x^5 - 5x^4 + 20x^2 - 16x.\]",\text{(D)},\textbf{(D)},(D)
