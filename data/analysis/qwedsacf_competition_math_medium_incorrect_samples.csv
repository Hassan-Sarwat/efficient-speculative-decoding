By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.

Checking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that

\[r - r \cos \theta = 1.\]Then $r = 1 + r \cos \theta = x + 1,$ so
\[r^2 = (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1.\]Hence, $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1,$ so
\[y^2 = 2x + 1.\]This represents the graph of a parabola, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$
